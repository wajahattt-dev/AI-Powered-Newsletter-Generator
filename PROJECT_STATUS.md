### How to Run the Project:

1. **Test Mode (Recommended - No API costs):**
   ```bash
   python test_run_offline.py
   ```
   - Uses mock summaries instead of OpenAI API
   - Perfect for testing the complete pipeline

2. **Normal Mode (Requires OpenAI API credits):**
   ```bash
   python -m src.main
   ```
   - Uses real AI summarization
   - Requires valid OpenAI API key with credits

3. **Using the Batch File:**
   ```bash
   run_newsletter.bat --test    # Test mode
   run_newsletter.bat           # Normal mode
   ```
